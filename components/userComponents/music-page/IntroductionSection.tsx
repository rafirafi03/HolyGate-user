  <span className='font-bold text-sm'>Great churches offer music that uplifts the soul — and at Veterans Sabah Church, our Music Ministry stands 
  as a proud expression of faith, excellence, and community.</span>
  <br />
  <span className='text-sm'>
Rooted in the spiritual and cultural heritage of Sabah, our music program 
continues to inspire worshippers through sacred song, heartfelt praise, and
 a deep commitment to musical artistry in service of God.
 <br />
The Veterans Sabah Church Choir is at the heart of our worship, blending 
voices of veterans, families, and local musicians in a rich harmony of tradition and contemporary sound. Through their dedication and talent, the choir brings to life a vibrant and prayerful music experience every week 
</span>

  <p className='text-sm'>Our church is blessed with a <span className='font-bold'> diverse repertoire</span> — from timeless hymns and classical 
    sacred works to modern praise and indigenous melodies that celebrate our unique cultural 
    identity. This blend of old and new creates a worship experience that is both reverent 
    and dynamic, connecting generations through song. 
    <br />
  Music is an integral part of our ministry, enhancing every service, celebration,
   and community gathering. Under the leadership of our Music Ministry team, we strive to 
   maintain the highest standards of musical devotion — not for performance, but for the glory
    of God and the joy of His people
