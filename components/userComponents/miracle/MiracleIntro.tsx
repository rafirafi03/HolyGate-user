      <span className="font-semibold">At Veterans Sabah Church</span>, we believe that miracles still happen every day — 
      in hearts transformed, lives restored, and faith renewed.
      <br /> Our church has been 
      blessed to witness countless moments of divine grace, where God’s presence brings 
      healing, hope, and peace beyond understanding.
      <br />
      From answered prayers and unexpected breakthroughs to stories of recovery and
       reconciliation, each testimony reminds us that God continues to move powerfully among His people.

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-4">A Living Testimony of Faith</h3>

      <p className="">
      Just as music fills our sanctuary with praise, the stories of God’s miracles fill our hearts with awe. 
      <br />
      We give glory to God for every life touched through prayer, worship, and fellowship within our church community.
      <br />
      Many of our veterans and families have shared how faith has brought comfort in times of struggle, strength in 
      times of weakness, and renewal in times of loss. Each story is a living testament that God is faithful, 
      yesterday, today, and forever.
